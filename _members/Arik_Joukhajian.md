I am beginning my graduate studies at UC Riverside after completing a Bachelors in Microbiology at UCLA. 

My broad interests in the life sciences led me to analyzing deep sea microbes, performing virus screening panels for transplant donors, and studying bacterial and fungal interactions around roots.

A general appreciation of nature drew my attention to the often overlooked kingdom fungi, and my curiosity surrounding symbioses drew me to lichen.
