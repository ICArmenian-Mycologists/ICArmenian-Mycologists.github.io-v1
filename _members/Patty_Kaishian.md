I am a Mycologist and postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University, where I serve as a curator of the Arthur Fungarium and Kriebel Herbarium. I am a fungal taxonomist, so I classify, name, describe, and generally cherish fungi. I received my PhD in Mycology from SUNY College of Environmental Science & Forestry in Syracuse, NY, in 2020. My dissertation was focused on the taxonomy and ecology of Laboulbeniales (Ascomycota). I have continued my research on this group, while also researching the plant pathogenic Rust fungi at Purdue.  

I am broadly trained in fungal biodiversity, with expertise spanning macro and micro fungal groups, and I have substantial experience working in a variety of habitats around the world.  I also enjoy stepping outside of more traditional science and have written on the topic of philosophy of science, feminist bioscience, ecofeminism, and queer theory. I am fascinated by how mycology and other scientific disciplines are situated in and informed by our sociopolitical landscape.
